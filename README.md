# Predicting Survival on the Titanic Based on Passenger Characteristics

## Context
This project is based on Kaggle's [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview).

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## Prerequisites
The project uses three libraries which is pandas, and sklearn.
```
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Results
This submission managed to garner a 76.55% accuracy score on Kaggle submissions using SVM with the `linear` kernel and 66.27% using SVM with the `rbf` kernel.
